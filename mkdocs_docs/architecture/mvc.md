# MVC Model

The Game of Life project implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, a widely used architectural approach that separates an application into three interconnected components:

## MVC Components

### Model
The Model manages the application data and business logic. It:
- Handles data storage and manipulation
- Implements rules and algorithms
- Maintains application state
- Notifies observers (typically the View) of state changes

### View
The View manages what the user sees. It:
- Displays data from the Model to the user
- Provides a visual representation of the application state
- Forwards user commands to the Controller
- Updates when the Model changes

### Controller
The Controller handles user interaction. It:
- Processes user input
- Updates the Model based on user actions
- May select which View to display
- Acts as an intermediary between Model and View

## MVC Implementation in our Project

The MVC pattern is implemented across different modules:

### Functions Module (fi)
- **Model**: `FiModel` - Manages neighborhood and growth function calculations
- **View**: `FiView` - Displays controls for function parameters
- **Controller**: `FiController` - Handles user interactions with function parameters

### Simulation Module (sim)
- **Model**: `SimModel` - Manages grid state and simulation logic
- **View**: Rendering of the grid (part of the main View)
- **Controller**: `SimController` - Controls simulation flow (start, pause, step)

### User Interface Module (us)
- **Model**: `UsModel` - Stores user settings and preferences
- **View**: `UsView` - Displays controls for user settings
- **Controller**: `UsController` - Processes user input for settings

### Window Management Module (wm)
- Primarily a View component, organizing the overall display

## MVC Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the MVC architecture of our application:

```
+------------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
|                  |     |                 |     |                 |
|       USER       |     |    Controller   |     |      Model      |
|                  |---->|                 |---->|                 |
|                  |     |                 |     |                 |
+------------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
         ^                                              |
         |                                              |
         |                                              v
         |                +-----------------+           |
         |                |                 |           |
         +----------------+      View       |<----------+
                          |                 |
                          |                 |
                          +-----------------+
```

1. The user interacts with the controller through interface elements
2. The controller processes these interactions and updates the model accordingly
3. The model manages the data and notifies the view of changes
4. The view updates to reflect the current state of the model
5. The user observes these changes, completing the interaction cycle

## Benefits of MVC

The use of the MVC pattern offers several advantages:

- **Separation of concerns**: Each component has a specific responsibility, making the code more organized
- **Easier testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Simplified maintenance**: Changes to one component are less likely to affect others
- **Parallel development**: Different team members can work on different components simultaneously
- **Component reusability**: Components can be reused in other projects or contexts

## Example Practical

For example, when the user clicks the "Start" button:

1. The **view** (`UsView`) captures this event
2. The **controller** (`UsController`) is notified and calls the appropriate method of the model
3. The **model** (`UsModel`) updates its internal state (goes to "running")
4. The **controller** (`SimController`) detects this change and starts updating the simulation
5. The simulation model (`SimModel`) updates the grid according to the defined rules
6. The simulation view (`SimView`) displays the updated grid

This separation allows for great flexibility while maintaining a well-structured code.
