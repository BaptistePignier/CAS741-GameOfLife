\section{Reference Material}

This section records information for easy reference.

\subsection{Table of Units}

Throughout this document SI (Syst\`{e}me International d'Unit\'{e}s) is employed
as the unit system.  In addition to the basic units, several derived units are
used as described below.  For each unit, the symbol is given followed by a
description of the unit and the SI name.
~\newline

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
%\begin{table}[ht]
  \noindent \begin{tabular}{l l l} 
    \toprule		
    \textbf{symbol} & \textbf{unit} & \textbf{SI}\\
    \midrule 
    \si{\metre} & length & metre\\
    \si{\kilogram} & mass	& kilogram\\
    \si{\second} & time & second\\
    \si{\celsius} & temperature & centigrade\\
    \si{\joule} & energy & joule\\
    \si{\watt} & power & watt (W = \si{\joule\per\second})\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  %	\caption{Provide a caption}
%\end{table}

\plt{Only include the units that your SRS actually uses.}

\plt{Derived units, like newtons, pascal, etc, should show their derivation
    (the units they are derived from) if their constituent units are in the
    table of units (that is, if the units they are derived from are used in the
    document).  For instance, the derivation of pascals as
    $\si{\pascal}=\si{\newton\per\square\meter}$ is shown if newtons and m are
    both in the table.  The derivations of newtons would not be shown if kg and
    s are not both in the table.}

\plt{The symbol for units named after people use capital letters, but the name
  of the unit itself uses lower case.  For instance, pascals use the symbol Pa,
  watts use the symbol W, teslas use the symbol T, newtons use the symbol N,
  etc.  The one exception to this is degree Celsius.  Details on writing metric
  units can be found on the 
  \href{https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/writing-metric-units}
  {NIST} web-page.}

\subsection{Table of Symbols}

The table that follows summarizes the symbols used in this document along with
their units.  The choice of symbols was made to be consistent with the heat
transfer literature and with existing documentation for solar water heating
systems.  The symbols are listed in alphabetical order.

\plt{This SRS template is based on \citet{SmithAndLai2005, SmithEtAl2007,
  SmithAndKoothoor2016}.  It will get you started.  You should not modify the
  section headings, without first discussing the change with the course
  instructor.  Modification means you are not following the template, which
  loses some of the advantage of a template, especially standardization.
  Although the bits shown below do not include type information, you may need to
  add this information for your problem.  If you are unsure, please can ask the
  instructor.}

\plt{Feel free to change the appearance of the report by modifying the LaTeX
  commands.}

\plt{This template document assumes that a single program is being documented.
  If you are documenting a family of models, you should start with a commonality
  analysis.  A separate template is provided for this.  For program
  families you should look at \cite{Smith2006, SmithMcCutchanAndCarette2017}.
  Single family member programs are often programs based on a single physical
  model.  General purpose tools are usually documented as a family.  Families of
  physical models also come up.}

\plt{The SRS is not generally written, or read, sequentially.  The SRS is a
  reference document.  It is generally read in an ad hoc order, as the need
  arises.  For writing an SRS, and for reading one for the first time, the
  suggested order of sections is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal Statement
\item Instance Models
\item Requirements
\item Introduction
\item Specific System Description
\end{itemize}
}

\plt{Guiding principles for the SRS document:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not repeat the same information at the same abstraction level.  If
  information is repeated, the repetition should be at a different abstraction
  level.  For instance, there will be overlap between the scope section and the
  assumptions, but the scope section will not go into as much detail as the
  assumptions section.
\end{itemize}
}

\plt{The template description comments should be disabled before submitting this
  document for grading.}

\plt{You can borrow any wording from the text given in the template.  It is part
  of the template, and not considered an instance of academic integrity.  Of
  course, you need to cite the source of the template.}

\plt{When the documentation is done, it should be possible to trace back to the
  source of every piece of information.  Some information will come from
  external sources, like terminology.  Other information will be derived, like
  General Definitions.}

\plt{An SRS document should have the following qualities: unambiguous,
  consistent, complete, validatable, abstract and traceable.}

\plt{The overall goal of the SRS is that someone that meets the Characteristics
  of the Intended Reader (Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}) can learn,
  understand and verify the captured domain knowledge.  They should not have to
  trust the authors of the SRS on any statements.  They should be able to
  independently verify/derive every statement made.}

\section{Introduction}

Conway's Game of Life is the result of applying simple rules of evolution.
It allows the observation of an emerging phenomenon called cellular automaton.
These cellular automata can be made more complex by making the rules of evolution more complex to observe more complex structure.

This section will develop the characteristics of the SRS document, more than those of the project itself.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements of the 
project in a clear and structured manner. This document serves as a communication tool between stakeholders, including clients, developers, 
and project managers, to ensure a shared understanding of the project's scope and objectives.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

This project aims to develop a simulation in a simplistic artificial environment. 
As such, the simulated elements will not be governed by any other physical law than those implemented by the environment. 
No assumptions will be made compared to a classic physical simulation model.
The presentation of assumptions is therefore not applicable to this project.

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}

Reviewers of this document should have undergraduate mathematical knowledge as well as a 
good understanding of the physical approximations that will be implemented.
He will also need to be aware of the different libraries used for this project.

\subsection{Organization of Document}

This document is structured as follows. Section 3 covers general information about the project. 
Section 4 explains this information in detail. Section 5 covers the project requirements. 
Section 6 lists the likely changes and Section 7 lists the unlikely changes. 
Section 8 presents the requirements traceability. Section 9 presents the project development plan.

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.

\subsection{System Context}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{SystemContext.png}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item The user will have no responsibility for the data he transmits to the system since they will be included in a range of values 
that the system will provide him.
\end{itemize}
\item \progname{} Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide the user with a simulation that faithfully matches the data the user has given to the system.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This software is intended for educational and/or artistic use. 
As such, its components must not be used for uses requiring security or critical requirements.

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

The user does not need any special knowledge to use the program. 
All useful information will be provided by the graphical window for selecting parameters.

\subsection{System Constraints}

No system constraints are identified for this project, as long as its requirements are met.

\section{Specific System Description}

This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level
view of the problem to be solved.  This is followed by the solution characteristics
specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, definitions and finally
the instance models.

\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}

\progname{} aims to demonstrate the emergence of macroscopic behavior and structure from microscopic generation and evolution rules.

\subsubsection{Terminology and  Definitions}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it
easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\begin{itemize}

\item A cell : A portion of a display area that contains one or more values

\item The grid : Grid cell size as small as possible. The dimensions of this grid are as large as desired.

\item Neighborhood : Area around a cell, consisting of the cells in that area. This area is delimited by a neighborhood function

\item Neighborhood function: Function that takes a cell as input and returns the cells in its neighborhood.

\item Growth function: Function that takes a cell as input and modifies the value(s) contained in the cell based on its neighborhood.

\item Structure: Finite set of cells in prolonged interaction

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Physical System Description} \label{sec_phySystDescrip}

The physical system of \progname{}, as shown in Figure~?, includes the following elements:

\begin{itemize}

\item[PS1 :] Cells

\item[PS2 :] Growth function

\item[PS3 :] Neighborhood function

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Goal Statements}

\noindent Given the input paramters, the goal statements are:

\begin{itemize}

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] Create the Growth function

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] Create the Neighborhood function

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] Apply iterative evolution

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] Define interesting evolution

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] Find some interesting evolution

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}

The instance models that govern \progname{} are presented in
Subsection~\ref{sec_instance}.  The information to understand the meaning of the
instance models and their derivation is also presented, so that the instance
models can be verified.


\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}

Since the project does not aim to model a physical system by simplifying it, 
no assumptions of physical simplification will be made. Therefore, this section is not relevant.

\subsubsection{Theoretical Models}\label{sec_theoretical}

This section focuses on the general equations and laws that \progname{} is based
on.

\subsubsection{Data Definitions}\label{sec_datadef}

This project does not use any physical data or quantities. This section is not relevant.


\subsubsection{Instance Models} \label{sec_instance}    

\plt{The motivation for this section is to reduce the problem defined in
  ``Physical System Description'' (Section~\ref{sec_phySystDescrip}) to one
  expressed in mathematical terms. The IMs are built by refining the TMs and/or
  GDs.  This section should remain abstract.  The SRS should specify the
  requirements without considering the implementation.}

This section transforms the problem defined in Section~\ref{Sec_pd} into 
one which is expressed in mathematical terms. It uses concrete symbols defined 
in Section~\ref{sec_datadef} to replace the abstract symbols in the models 
identified in Sections~\ref{sec_theoretical} and~\ref{sec_gendef}.

The goals \plt{reference your goals} are solved by \plt{reference your instance
  models}.  \plt{other details, with cross-references where appropriate.}
\plt{Modify the examples below for your problem, and add additional models as
  appropriate.}

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints}    

TODO

Table~\ref{TblInputVar} shows the data constraints on the input output
variables.  The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations
on the range of values that can be taken by the variable.  The column for
software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.  The
software constraints will be helpful in the design stage for picking suitable
algorithms.  The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.  The column of typical values
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.  The uncertainty column
provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be
measured.  This information would be part of the input if one were performing an
uncertainty quantification exercise.

The specification parameters in Table~\ref{TblInputVar} are listed in
Table~\ref{TblSpecParams}.

\section{Requirements}

This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] Input data will be given by the user before the simulation starts and 
must be modifiable during the simulation.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Calculate}:] The program must calculate step by step the results of applying the growth function to each cell.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Output}:] The output should allow the user to correctly distinguish between concentrations of value.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\plt{List your nonfunctional requirements.  You may consider using a fit
  criterion to make them verifiable.}
\plt{The goal is for the nonfunctional requirements to be unambiguous, abstract
  and verifiable.  This isn't easy to show succinctly, so a good strategy may be
to give a ``high level'' view of the requirement, but allow for the details to
be covered in the Verification and Validation document.}
\plt{An absolute requirement on a quality of the system is rarely needed.  For
  instance, an accuracy of 0.0101 \% is likely fine, even if the requirement is
  for 0.01 \% accuracy.  Therefore, the emphasis will often be more on
  describing now well the quality is achieved, through experimentation, and
  possibly theory, rather than meeting some bar that was defined a priori.}
\plt{You do not need an entry for correctness in your NFRs.  The purpose of the
  SRS is to record the requirements that need to be satisfied for correctness.
  Any statement of correctness would just be redundant. Rather than discuss
  correctness, you can characterize how far away from the correct (true)
  solution you are allowed to be.  This is discussed under accuracy.}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Accuracy}:]
  \textbf{Accuracy} The accuracy of the computed solutions should meet the level needed for correct visualization

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability}:] This software must be able to be used without any special skills or knowledge.

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Maintainability}:]
  \textbf{Maintainability} The effort required to make any of the likely
    changes listed for \progname{} should be less than $\epsilon$ of the original
    development time.

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Portability}:]
  \textbf{Portability} This program should run on all operating systems supported by the libraries used.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rationale}

It is clear that significant mathematical and physics skills are required to simulate a biologically accurate cellular automaton development environment. 
Not having such skills, I limit myself to a basic but correct and useful implementation of a cellular automaton simulation.

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

\plt{You will have to modify these tables for your problem.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is not generally symmetric.  If GD1 uses A1, that
  means that GD1's derivation or presentation requires invocation of A1.  A1
  does not use GD1.  A1 is ``used by'' GD1.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is challenging to maintain manually.  Please do
  your best.  In the future tools (like Drasil) will make this much easier.}

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
changed. Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.
